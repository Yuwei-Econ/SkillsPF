# SkillsPF

Here I archive work undertaken for my MPhil thesis at Oxford University, in which I investigate the estimation of production functions in skills and health.

To take a look at the finished thesis, see the pdf document. 

The simulations section consists of a large number of scripts looking at different scenarios - see the PDF for an explanation.

All code here, but data removed as cannot be made public.
